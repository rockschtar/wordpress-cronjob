Brain Monkey is a tests utility for PHP.

It provides **two set of helpers**:

  - the first are framework-agnostic tools that allow to mock (or *monkey patch*) and to test behavior of any **PHP function**
  - the second are **specific to WordPress** and make unit testing of WordPress extensions a no-brainer.
